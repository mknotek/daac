## Issues with current deployers - definition of problem
- dependent on software supplier,
- not opensource, closed community,
- hard to become SME in proper deployer,
- do not support common deployment scenarios ootb - blue/green deployments etc.,
- not sufficient integration with other tools - e.g. with CI,
- deployers are suitable to do everything from deployment to orchestration to process automation,
- using of propietary formats to exchange information,
## Goals
- Create simple, extensible deployer that would support several deployment mechanisms,
- Deployer is fully modular, with separated BE and FE,
- environments are intuitive and easy to use,
- written in python,
- all configuration is stored in json or config files,
- TBC
